## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added

#### Web Interface Enhancements
- **File Cloning Detection**: Added clone button next to info button for files with identical SHA256 hashes
  - Shows count of duplicate files in user's collection
  - Displays all clones across all users (cross-user clone detection)
  - Modal with detailed table showing hostname, filepath, size, and status
  - Special handling for zero-length files (shows "0" disabled button)
  - Non-zero files always have active clone button for discovering epoch files

#### Epoch File Management
- **Epoch File Highlighting**: First uploaded file with content (epoch file) is visually distinguished
  - Green background highlighting (#d4edda)
  - Green left border (4px) and bottom border (2px)
  - Green "EPOCH" badge for clear identification
  - Automatic sorting: epoch file first, then metadata-only files
  - Cross-user epoch file linking: metadata files can now link to epoch files uploaded by other users

#### Visual Improvements
- **Zero-Length File Indicators**: Special icon (ðŸ“­) for empty files
- **Improved Modal Layout**:
  - Increased modal width from 700px to 1200px for better visibility
  - Added scrolling support for long file lists
  - Fixed table layout with proper column widths
  - Word wrapping for long file paths
  - Responsive design with max-height constraints

#### Client Improvements
- **Graceful Interrupt Handling**: ppclient now handles Ctrl-C cleanly
  - Finishes processing current file before exiting
  - Displays partial completion status
  - Shows count of remaining unprocessed files
  - Second Ctrl-C forces immediate termination
  - Proper exit codes for automation/scripting

### Changed
- Clone detection now queries all files across all users, not just current user's files
- Clone button is now always active for non-zero-length files (removed disabled state for single files)
- Modal content area now uses flexbox layout for better scrolling behavior

### Technical
- Added new API endpoint: `GET /api/clones/{sha256}` - Retrieve all files with identical SHA256 across all users
- Added new database method: `get_files_by_sha256()` - Query files by SHA256 hash with epoch file sorting
- Added signal handling (SIGINT) to ppclient for graceful shutdown
- Improved CSS styling for modal dialogs and table layouts
